# Splits for Mac

Changelog: [changelog.txt](https://github.com/lambdan/Splits/blob/master/changelog.txt)

Builds available under the [Releases tab](https://github.com/lambdan/Splits/releases), or just download & install Xcode, and then download this entire repo and build it yourself

Because I am not a registered Apple developer, you might have to adjust your Mac's Gatekeeper settings

## Features

- Create and edit splits
- Does not require Java
- Import/Export splits from/to WSplit
- Visually customizable with CSS

## How do I change looks?

Run the app, and in the Menu Bar under __Splits__ you will find _Open HTML Folder_. Click that, and you will find a file called `splitscss.css` which you can modify to your liking, assuming you know CSS.
