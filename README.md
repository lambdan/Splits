i've decided to pick this up again since ewaller doesnt seem very active with it, and there are some changes that i really need for me to use this program.
and even after that, im not sure if i will use it because of alternatives like Llanfair. i guess this is more for fun :)

im not used at all to xcode, c++ or osx programs coding, so this will probably be a bumpy ride.
